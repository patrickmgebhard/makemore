    "Problem: I'm not so confident in my understanding, because I couldn't explain this stuff easily to someone else. Okay, so try to solve it in a way that you actually understand what's going on and then be able to play around with it. So, take 1 example and then do the following:\n",
    "- construct a simple neural net (MLP???)\n",
    "- figure out how to visualize this with graphviz\n",
    "- implement loss function\n",
    "- implement backprop\n",
    "- implement training\n",
    "- use better learning rate\n",
    "- optimize initial loss\n",
    "- optimize activations\n",
    "- optimize gradients\n",
    "- use BatchNorm\n",
    "- use batch normalization\n",
    "- experiment with larger hidden layer\n",
    "- how do you actually use the network in the end???\n",
